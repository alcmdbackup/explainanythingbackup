## Goal
Produce high quality content through larger-scale AI generation combined with human feedback.

## Key principles
1. **Speed** - Rely on AI generation rather than human editing, since it is significantly faster and cheaper. It is easier for AI to generate/edit and have humans provide feedback, rather than humans write and edit.
2. **Attribution** - The person who first creates or pioneers content content on the platform receives attribution for all downstream uses and derivatives. 
2. **Growth** - Define growth in terms of content creation and content consumption. Use economic incentives around attribution and links to drive content creation. Cater to agents and SEO to drive content consumption.

### **Attribution**
- **Meaning** - who produced a given piece of content, which could be a small paragraph in an article or an entire article
- **Algorithmic Fairness** - platform should be able to account for original authorship regardless of how content is shared, referenced, or adapted
- **Protection** - Make it difficult to get external content into the platform. Make copy/paste window small. All links consumed by prompt and agent must be recorded. Agents can be later used to verify potential plagiarism. 

### **Feedback**
- Feedback can be collected in many forms - we will use ML or other means to analyze quality of content

### **Article scoring**
- **Aggregated scoring of similar articles** - Within a given topic, it is critical that article be scored based on the content of similar articles. This will allow the bootstrapping of much better content overall. Think of a DAG - like voting.
