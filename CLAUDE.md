# My defaults
- Always prioritize being concise even a the expense of grammar
- Always prefer to re-use existing code rather than writing new code.
- After every code block you write, lint, compile and write corresponding tests and run them before writing the next code block. 
- Prefer TypeScript, strict mode.
- For debugging, always look at server.log and client.log on local path
- For debugging, also use playwright mcp server. If need to log in, use abecha@gmail.com as username, password as password
