# Evolution Pipeline Architecture

Pipeline orchestration, phase transitions, stopping conditions, checkpoint/resume, and data flow for the evolution content improvement system.

## Overview

The evolution pipeline is an autonomous content improvement system that iteratively generates, competes, and refines text variations of existing articles using LLM-driven agents. It operates as a self-contained subsystem under `src/lib/evolution/` with its own agent framework, OpenSkill Bayesian rating system, budget enforcement, and checkpoint/resume capability.

The pipeline uses an evolutionary algorithm metaphor: a pool of text variants competes via LLM-judged pairwise comparisons, top performers reproduce via mutation and crossover, and the population converges toward higher quality through iterative selection pressure.

```
\* OutlineGenerationAgent gated by `evolution_outline_generation_enabled` feature flag (default: `false`). See [Generation Agents](./agents/generation.md).

## Two-Phase Pipeline

The pipeline uses a **PoolSupervisor** (`core/supervisor.ts`) that manages a one-way phase transition:

**EXPANSION** (iterations 0-N): Build a diverse pool of variants
- GenerationAgent creates 3 variants per iteration using three strategies: `structural_transform`, `lexical_simplify`, `grounding_enhance`. **Note:** The supervisor prepares a strategy payload that collapses to a single strategy when diversity is low, but the current `GenerationAgent` implementation always uses its own hardcoded `STRATEGIES` constant — the supervisor's strategy routing is not yet consumed.
- CalibrationRanker runs pairwise comparisons for new entrants against stratified opponents (3 opponents per entrant in this phase).
- ProximityAgent computes diversity score (1 - mean pairwise cosine similarity of top 10 variants).

**Transition** to COMPETITION occurs when **(pool size >= 15 AND diversity >= 0.25) OR iteration >= 8**. The iteration-8 safety cap ensures COMPETITION always starts even if diversity remains low. Transition is **one-way** and locked once triggered — the pipeline never returns to EXPANSION.

**COMPETITION** (iterations N+1 to max): Refine the best variants
- GenerationAgent creates 3 variants per iteration (same as EXPANSION). **Note:** The supervisor prepares a rotating single-strategy payload for COMPETITION, but the current `GenerationAgent` does not consume it — it always generates all 3 strategies. This is a known gap between the supervisor's design intent and the agent's implementation.
- OutlineGenerationAgent (if enabled) creates 1 outline-based variant via a 6-call pipeline. See [Generation Agents](./agents/generation.md).
- ReflectionAgent critiques top 3 variants across 5 dimensions. See [Support Agents](./agents/support.md#reflectionagent).
- IterativeEditingAgent takes the top variant and applies critique-driven surgical edits. See [Editing Agents](./agents/editing.md#iterative-editing-agent-whole-article).
- SectionDecompositionAgent decomposes top variant into H2 sections for parallel editing. See [Editing Agents](./agents/editing.md#section-decomposition-agent-hierarchical).
- DebateAgent runs a structured 3-turn debate on top 2 non-baseline variants. See [Support Agents](./agents/support.md#debateagent).
- EvolutionAgent creates children via mutation, crossover, and creative exploration. See [Support Agents](./agents/support.md#evolutionagent-evolvepool).
- Ranking agent: **Tournament** (Swiss-style, default) or **CalibrationRanker** (if `evolution_tournament_enabled` flag is false). Uses 5 opponents per entrant in this phase.
- ProximityAgent continues diversity monitoring. See [Support Agents](./agents/support.md#proximityagent).
- MetaReviewAgent analyzes strategy performance and provides meta-feedback. See [Support Agents](./agents/support.md#metareviewagent).

## Two Pipeline Modes

- **`executeFullPipeline`**: Production path. Uses PoolSupervisor for EXPANSION→COMPETITION phase transitions, checkpoint after each agent, convergence detection, and supervisor state persistence. Used by admin trigger, cron runner, batch runner, standalone runner, and local CLI `--full` mode. All callsites use `createDefaultAgents()` for consistent 12-agent construction and `finalizePipelineRun()` for shared post-completion persistence.
- **`executeMinimalPipeline`**: Simplified single-pass mode with no phase transitions. Runs a caller-provided list of agents once. Used for testing, custom agent sequences, and the local CLI runner (`run-evolution-local.ts`) default mode (generation + calibration only).

## Append-Only Pool

Variants are never removed from the pool during a run. Low-performing variants naturally sink in Elo and become less likely to be selected as parents for evolution. However, they remain available because they may contain novel structural or stylistic elements useful for future crossover operations.

## Checkpoint, Resume, and Error Recovery

State is checkpointed to `evolution_checkpoints` table after every agent execution:
- Full pipeline state serialized to JSON (pool, ratings, match history, critiques, diversity, meta-feedback)
- Supervisor resume state preserved (phase, strategy rotation index, ordinal/diversity history). **Note:** `ordinalHistory` and `diversityHistory` are cleared when EXPANSION→COMPETITION transition occurs, so these arrays only track COMPETITION phase metrics.
- Heartbeat updates to `content_evolution_runs` after every agent step

### Error Recovery Paths

| Failure Mode | Pipeline Behavior | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Agent throws error | Partial state checkpointed, run marked `failed` | Variants generated before failure are preserved. Queue a new run to retry. |
| Budget exceeded | Run marked `paused`, not `failed` | Admin can increase budget. Batch runner or trigger action loads latest checkpoint and resumes. |
| Runner crashes (no heartbeat) | Watchdog cron marks run `failed` after 10 minutes | Queue a new run. Checkpoint data may allow manual investigation. |
| All variants rejected by format validator | Pool doesn't grow for that iteration | Pipeline continues but may hit degenerate state stop (diversity < 0.01). |

**Resume mechanism**: The batch runner and `triggerEvolutionRunAction` both support loading the latest checkpoint from `evolution_checkpoints.state_snapshot`, deserializing `PipelineState`, and restoring `supervisorState` (phase, rotation index, history) to continue from the next scheduled agent.

## Stopping Conditions

The PoolSupervisor evaluates four stopping conditions at the start of each iteration:

1. **Quality plateau** (COMPETITION only): If the top variant's ordinal improves by less than `threshold x 6` ordinal points (default: 0.12) over the last `window` iterations (default: 3), the pool has converged and further iterations are unlikely to find improvements.
2. **Budget exhausted**: If available budget drops below $0.01, stop immediately.
3. **Max iterations**: Hard cap at `maxIterations` (default: 15).
4. **Degenerate state**: If diversity score drops below 0.01 during a plateau check, the pool has collapsed to near-identical variants — continuing would waste budget.

## Data Flow

### Full Pipeline Execution

```
1. Run Queued (admin UI or auto-queue cron for articles scoring < 0.4)
   └─ Insert into content_evolution_runs (status='pending')

2. Runner Claims Run (batch script or admin trigger)
   └─ Atomic claim via claim_evolution_run() RPC (fallback: UPDATE WHERE status='pending')
   └─ Initialize: PipelineStateImpl, CostTracker, LLMClient, Logger, Agents
   └─ Insert baseline variant (original text at Elo 1200)

3. Pipeline Loop (up to maxIterations=15)
   ├─ state.startNewIteration() → clears newEntrantsThisIteration
   ├─ Supervisor.beginIteration() → detect/lock phase
   ├─ Supervisor.getPhaseConfig() → which agents run this iteration
   ├─ Supervisor.shouldStop() → check plateau/budget/iterations/degenerate
   │
   ├─ [EXPANSION]
   │   ├─ GenerationAgent → 3 new variants (all 3 strategies)
   │   ├─ CalibrationRanker → new entrants vs 3 stratified opponents
   │   └─ ProximityAgent → diversity score update
   │
   ├─ [COMPETITION]
   │   ├─ GenerationAgent → 3 new variants (all 3 strategies)
   │   ├─ OutlineGenerationAgent* → 1 outline variant (6-call pipeline, step scores)
   │   ├─ ReflectionAgent → critique top 3 variants (5 dimensions)
   │   ├─ IterativeEditingAgent → critique→edit→judge on top variant → accepted edits
   │   ├─ SectionDecompositionAgent → parse H2 sections, parallel edit, stitch → stitched variant
   │   ├─ DebateAgent → 3-turn debate on top 2 → synthesis variant
   │   ├─ EvolutionAgent → mutate_clarity, mutate_structure, crossover, creative_exploration
   │   ├─ Tournament or CalibrationRanker → ranking with 5 opponents per entrant
   │   ├─ ProximityAgent → diversity score update
   │   └─ MetaReviewAgent → meta-feedback for next iteration
   │
   └─ Checkpoint after each agent + supervisor state at end-of-iteration

4. Stopping Conditions (checked at iteration start)
   ├─ Quality plateau (top ordinal change < 0.12 over 3 iterations)
   ├─ Budget exhausted (available < $0.01)
   ├─ Max iterations reached (default: 15)
   └─ Degenerate state (diversity < 0.01 during plateau)

5. Pipeline Completion
   ├─ Build EvolutionRunSummary via buildRunSummary()
   ├─ Validate with Zod schema (non-fatal — null on failure)
   ├─ Persist run_summary to content_evolution_runs (JSONB)
   ├─ Persist all variants to content_evolution_variants for admin UI
   ├─ Compute cost_prediction (estimated vs actual delta, per-agent) if cost_estimate_detail exists
   └─ Fire-and-forget refreshAgentCostBaselines(30) to update estimation baselines

6. Winner Application (admin action via applyWinnerAction)
   ├─ Replaces entire explanations.content column (including H1 title)
   ├─ Previous content saved to content_history (source='evolution_pipeline')
   ├─ Variant marked is_winner=true in content_evolution_variants
   └─ Triggers post-evolution quality eval (fire-and-forget, gated by
      content_quality_eval_enabled feature flag — silently skips if disabled)

   Note: explanation_title column is NOT updated — only content changes.
   This can cause title mismatches if the winning variant's H1 differs.
```

## Known Implementation Gaps

1. **Supervisor strategy routing**: The supervisor prepares strategy payloads (single-strategy in COMPETITION, collapsed when diversity is low), but `GenerationAgent` always uses its own hardcoded `STRATEGIES` constant. The supervisor's intent is not consumed.
2. **Title mismatch**: `applyWinnerAction` replaces `explanations.content` but does not update `explanation_title`. If the winning variant's H1 differs from the original, the database title and content title will diverge.
