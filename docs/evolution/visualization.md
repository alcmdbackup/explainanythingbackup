# Evolution Visualization

Visual monitoring and debugging tools for the evolution pipeline. Provides an operational dashboard, per-run timeline/rating/lineage/budget analysis, and before/after text comparison.

Built with Recharts for standard charts and D3.js for the variant lineage DAG. Rating data uses OpenSkill ordinal values (mu - 3*sigma), mapped to the legacy 0-3000 Elo scale for display via `ordinalToEloScale()`.

## Pages

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/admin/evolution-dashboard` | Evolution overview: quick links, run/spend charts, recent runs table |
| `/admin/quality/evolution` | Run management: queue new runs via Start Run card (prompt + strategy + budget selector), filter by status/date, variant panel, apply winner, rollback, cost charts |
| `/admin/quality/evolution/run/[runId]` | Run detail: 6-tab deep dive (Timeline, Elo, Lineage, Tree, Budget, Variants) + Add to Hall of Fame dialog |
| `/admin/quality/evolution/run/[runId]/compare` | Before/after text diff, stats summary (includes generationDepth) |

### Server Actions (`src/lib/services/evolutionVisualizationActions.ts`)

8 read-only actions following the `withLogging + requireAdmin + serverReadRequestId` pattern:

1. `getEvolutionDashboardDataAction` — System-wide stats, runs/spend trends
2. `getEvolutionRunTimelineAction` — Per-iteration agent execution breakdown with checkpoint diffing for accurate per-agent metrics (variants added, matches played, rating changes) and timestamp-based cost attribution
3. `getEvolutionRunEloHistoryAction` — Rating trajectories from checkpoints (reads both new `ratings` and legacy `eloRatings` snapshot formats, mapped to Elo scale via `ordinalToEloScale`)
4. `getEvolutionRunLineageAction` — Variant parentage DAG from latest checkpoint (augmented with `treeSearchPath` for path highlighting and per-node `treeDepth`/`revisionAction`)
5. `getEvolutionRunBudgetAction` — Cumulative cost burn + agent breakdown + cost estimate/prediction fields
6. `getEvolutionRunComparisonAction` — Original vs winner text, Elo delta, `generationDepth` (max variant version in pool)
7. `getEvolutionRunStepScoresAction` — Per-variant step scores for outline variants (returns `VariantStepData[]` with step names, scores, costs, and weakest step)
8. `getEvolutionRunTreeSearchAction` — Tree search state: full tree nodes with depth/pruning/actions for the Tree tab

Additionally, the run detail page uses `getEvolutionRunSummaryAction(runId)` from `evolutionActions.ts` to display the validated `EvolutionRunSummary` (stop reason, Elo/diversity history, match stats, baseline rank).

### Run Detail Features

- **Add to Hall of Fame dialog**: Modal on the run detail page that exports the winner variant (and optionally the baseline) to the [Hall of Fame](./hall_of_fame.md). Prompts for a topic description and calls `addToHallOfFameAction()`.
- **Compare button**: Links to the `/compare` sub-route for before/after text diff with stats summary and generation depth.

### Timeline Tab - Per-Agent Detail

The Timeline tab shows all agents that executed in each iteration.

**Agent count by phase**:

| Phase | Agent Count | Agents |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| EXPANSION | 3 | Generation, Calibration, Proximity |
| COMPETITION | 12 | Generation, OutlineGeneration*, Reflection, FlowCritique*, IterativeEditing*, TreeSearch*, SectionDecomposition*, Debate*, Evolution*, Tournament/Calibration, Proximity, MetaReview |

\* Agents marked with asterisk can be disabled via [feature flags](./reference.md#feature-flags).

**Metrics shown per agent**:
- Variants added (pool growth from checkpoint diff)
- Matches played (for ranking agents only — Generation/Reflection/etc. show 0)
- Cost in USD (timestamp-correlated from llmCallTracking)
- Diversity score after execution
- New variant IDs (expandable list)
- Elo changes per variant (color-coded +/-)

**Data computation**: Uses sequential checkpoint diffing within each iteration to compute accurate per-agent metrics. The first agent in an iteration diffs against the previous iteration's final checkpoint.

**Cost attribution**: Uses timestamp correlation between LLM calls and checkpoint boundaries. May be imprecise for concurrent runs (logged warning).

**Expandable detail**: Click any agent row to see full metrics including new variant IDs, Elo changes, and error messages.

### Budget Tab - Estimated vs Actual

When a completed run has `cost_estimate_detail` and `cost_prediction`, the Budget tab shows an "Estimated vs Actual" comparison panel:
- Summary delta badge (color-coded: ≤10% green, ≤30% amber, >30% red)
- Per-agent comparison bars (estimated outline vs actual solid, with dollar amounts)
- Confidence badge from the pre-run estimate

The runs table also displays an "Est." column showing `estimated_cost_usd` with the same color-coding scheme applied to completed runs by comparing estimate accuracy.

### Cost Analytics Actions (`src/lib/services/costAnalyticsActions.ts`)

Separate from visualization actions, this file provides system-wide cost accuracy analytics:
- `getStrategyAccuracyAction()` — Per-strategy avg delta %, std dev, run count
- `getCostAccuracyOverviewAction()` — Delta trend, per-agent accuracy, confidence calibration, outliers

These power the strategy detail row accuracy display and the Cost Accuracy tab on the optimization dashboard.

### Step Score Visualization

The Variants tab displays step-level scores for outline variants via the `StepScoreBar` component:

- **Trigger**: When a variant row is expanded, step score data is fetched via `getEvolutionRunStepScoresAction`
- **Display**: Horizontal bar chart with one bar per step (outline, expand, polish, verify)
- **Color coding**: Green (score >= 0.8), yellow (0.5-0.8), red (< 0.5)
- **Weakest step**: Highlighted with the `--status-error` design token color
- **Conditional**: Only rendered for variants where `isOutlineVariant()` returns true

The step score data is fetched in `Promise.all` alongside existing variant data to avoid waterfall requests.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Checkpoint-first lineage**: Lineage visualization uses in-memory `TextVariation.parentIds` from checkpoint data. DB `parent_variant_id` is now populated by the local CLI runner, but production runs may still have NULL parent IDs
- **In-memory vs DB IDs**: Checkpoint variant IDs differ from DB UUIDs; lineage/Elo features operate entirely on checkpoint data
- **Auto-polling**: Only the dashboard page polls (15s). Other tabs load data once on selection
- **D3 + React hybrid**: D3 renders SVG via `useRef` + `useEffect`; React handles the side panel
- **SSR disabled**: All chart components use `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`
