# Overview
Periodically, we will need to make sure that key docs are up to date. 

# Instruction
- Follow guidance below on which parts of code base to follow for which docs.
- Also, make sure your updates are concise and precise. 

# What must be updated
- /docs/docs_overall - architecture.md and product_overview ONLY. For these, look at the entire codebase. WARNING Do not touch instructions for updating, or white_paper
- All files under feature_deep_dives should be updated. Look at the codebase generally, and deep dive on specific relevant parts of the code to update these.
