# Evolution Pipeline Documentation

Entry point for all evolution pipeline documentation. The evolution pipeline is an autonomous content improvement system that iteratively generates, competes, and refines text variations using LLM-driven agents.

## Reading Order

## Unified Arena Rating

The evolution system uses a **single OpenSkill (Bayesian, mu/sigma) rating system**. Arena entries are loaded into `state.pool` at pipeline start, rated naturally alongside new variants during the run, and synced back atomically at completion. See [Arena](./arena.md) for the unified pool model and [Rating & Comparison](./rating_and_comparison.md) for algorithm details.

## Config Validation & Kill Mechanism

The pipeline includes two operational safety features:

- **Config validation** — Strategy configs are validated at queue time (`validateStrategyConfig`) and run time (`validateRunConfig`). The admin UI shows inline warnings when a problematic strategy is selected and disables the "Start Pipeline" button. See [Architecture — Config Validation](./architecture.md#config-validation).
- **Kill mechanism** — Running/claimed runs can be killed by an admin via the dashboard Kill button. The pipeline detects the kill at the next iteration boundary using a three-checkpoint defense-in-depth design. See [Architecture — Kill Mechanism](./architecture.md#kill-mechanism).
- **Test name filtering** — Prompts and strategies with "test" in their name are hidden from the Start Pipeline dropdowns via the `isTestEntry()` predicate. Admin management pages still show all entries.

## Code Layout

The evolution system lives under `evolution/src/lib/` with integration points in `evolution/src/services/`, `evolution/src/components/evolution/`, and `evolution/scripts/`. See [Reference — Key Files](./reference.md#key-files) for the complete file index.
